- **Learning**: Contains all the learning resources (documents, tutorials, notes) used for training in NLP, data collection, and fine-tuning Transformer models.
- **Project**: Includes the source code, datasets, trained models, and analysis reports related to the ABSA project.

The aim is to facilitate knowledge sharing and collaboration while maintaining a clear project development structure.
